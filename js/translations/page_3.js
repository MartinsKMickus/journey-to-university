                once being 20 rides for 5 euros, now it is offered as monthly subscription for 15 euros.
                I wouldn't say that is good, but still there are a lot of other things that can cheer up when going to university.`,

                when I will remember my daily routes in the future.
                I always think about streets and building locations when I see how well city is structured.
                For other countries everything is just much closer together making great environment and there are shops everywhere,
                but here I usually see quite empty streets and everything has its distance.
                I think it would be better that everything is closer together.`,

                Library building is with unique shape but its window cleaning cost is high.
