                Wok To Walk is delicious to try but it won't be something to eat regularly firstly because it is expensive
                and also noodles are not the thing to eat all the time.
                There is also option to choose different path and go to Narvesen in case when I want a drink or quick snack.`,
    text_3: `When getting closer to University it is possible to see Latvian National Opera.
            Opera is a huge building right in front of the university,
            with its uniqueness it stands out from other buildings in the area.`,
