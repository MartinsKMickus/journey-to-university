            Being here always brings back memories of first year,
            when everything was more of a routine and there were late classes of network management course in the basement class.`,
    text_2: `In path to get to the lectures there are also long corridors to walk.
            These corridors are so long that the light from window cannot really make it to the center of them
            as a result light looks weird in here.
            Some time ago there were caffeteria in university itself but now it is closed so different options has to be made.
            There is a good caffeteria called "Pusbalsī" in Latvian Academy of Music where I go at lunch break.`,
    text_3: `When the last lectures are happening, I am thinking of what to do next.
            There are few options: take a bus to home, walk to home or go to swimming pool`,
