            Being here always brings back memories of the first year.
            Back then everything was more like a routine. My favorite classes were those down in the basement.`,
    text_2: `In path to get to the lectures there are also long corridors to walk.
            These corridors are so long that the light from window cannot really make it to the building center
            as a result light looks weird in here.
            Some time ago there was cafeteria in university itself but now it is closed
            because of that lunch option should be considered elsewhere.
            Form my lunch break I have chosen cafeteria called "Pusbalsī" which is in Latvian Academy of Music.`,
    text_3: `When the day is about to end I think of what to do next.
            There are few options: take a bus to home, walk to home or go to swimming pool.`,
