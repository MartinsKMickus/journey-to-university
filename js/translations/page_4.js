                There was a time when I visited Stokmann often and I usually went there to get a cup of coffee.
                It was also great when Ben&Jerry's ice cream had discount, got few of them.`,
    text_2: `Other great place here is cinema where it is possible to see newest movies.
                Now there is nearly no time to go to watch a movie, but there was time in the past.
                One thing I can mention here, there is beet juice sold here which I tried and it was amazing,
                also improving thinking and providing body with beneficial vitamins.`,
    text_3: `I liked the routine that was created.
                Each Tuesday going to get a coffee was one of the favorite things to do.`,
